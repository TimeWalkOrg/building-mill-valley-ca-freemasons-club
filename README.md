## Building History

Mill Valley’s Masonic Lodge was originally built in 1903 and designed by Harvey Klyce. In 1928 a two-story addition was built. In 2012 the ground floor was established as the re-incarnation of the Sweetwater Music Hall (formerly at 153 Throckmorton), with the upper floor still housing the Mill Valley Lodge No. 356 Free and Accepted Masons.
